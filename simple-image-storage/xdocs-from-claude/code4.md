I've created a complete Simple Image Storage System using Spring Boot 3, Java 21, and Maven. This system allows users to upload, view, manage, and download images with a clean and responsive user interface.

## Project Features

- **Upload Images**: Drag and drop interface with preview, description field, and file validation
- **View Images**: Gallery view and detailed image view with metadata
- **Manage Images**: Update descriptions, download, and delete images
- **Search Functionality**: Search by name and filter by type
- **REST API**: Endpoints for programmatic access to the image data

## Technical Implementation

The project follows a standard Spring Boot architecture with:

1. **Model Layer**: Image entity with necessary fields for storing metadata
2. **Repository Layer**: JPA repository for database operations
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic for image storage, retrieval, and management
4. **Controller Layer**: Web and REST endpoints for user interaction
5. **View Layer**: Thymeleaf templates for the user interface

## Key Components

- **Storage Management**: File storage with metadata extraction
- **Error Handling**: Global exception handler and custom exceptions
- **UI/UX**: Responsive Bootstrap interface with JavaScript enhancements
- **Testing**: Unit tests for controllers and services

## How to Run

1. Clone the project
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run: `mvn spring-boot:run`
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

The system uses an H2 database for simplicity, but you can easily switch to another database like MySQL or PostgreSQL by updating the dependencies and configuration.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
