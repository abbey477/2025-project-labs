I'll continue with the parallel streams example and add a couple more tutorials for your Spring Boot Java 17 lambda expression project:

Let me add two more tutorials to cover additional lambda expression concepts:

I've created a comprehensive Spring Boot Java 17 standalone (no-web) Maven project with multiple tutorials focusing on lambda expressions. Here's what the tutorial includes:

### Project Structure:

The project is organized with a standard Maven structure and includes:
- A main Spring Boot application class
- Eight tutorial modules, each focusing on different aspects of lambda expressions

### Key Features:

1. **Basic Lambda Syntax** - Covers basic lambda syntax, parameter types, and body styles
2. **Method References** - Demonstrates static, instance, and constructor references
3. **Stream API with Lambdas** - Shows how to filter, map, and reduce collections
4. **Functional Interfaces and Composition** - Teaches how to combine and compose functions
5. **Effective Lambda Patterns** - Covers design patterns like Strategy, Builder, and Decorator
6. **Parallel Streams and Performance** - Compares sequential vs. parallel performance
7. **Exception Handling with Lambdas** - Various techniques for handling exceptions in lambdas
8. **Java 17 Specific Features** - Shows how to use lambdas with Java 17's sealed classes and records

### How to Use:

The project is designed to be run as a standalone Spring Boot application. When executed, each tutorial module will run sequentially, with clear output markers separating each section. This approach makes it easy to follow along and understand each concept.

The project includes a complete Maven configuration with Spring Boot dependencies, and all code is written for Java 17, taking advantage of the latest language features.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the tutorials in more detail?
